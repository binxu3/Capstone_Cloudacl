## Project Introduction:

### About the company:

Cloudacl is the leading provider of security and infrastructure services that make the Internet safer through integrated Web content filtering. Cloudacl services enable family, school and small business user to secure their networks from online threats, reduce costs and enforce Internet-use policies.

### About our technology

#### Cloud based services

Cloudacl is powered by a cloud based service hosted on Amazon EC2. It is based on Hadoop software stack and can scale out to thousands of servers, providing high realtime performance and powerful analytical backend at the same time.

### Website classifier

Cloudacl uses the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to automatically classify websites into different categories. Our classifier works under the standard cloud-computing platform (i.e. mapreduce under hadoop), so it can scale up to classify  millions of websites. Moreover, it uses very sophisticated natural language processing techniques to extract classification signals from website content, so it can support many international languages in addition to English.
